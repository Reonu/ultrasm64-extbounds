 * Press Start to end the recording.
 * Copy the console output to a new file in `assets/demos/`. The name of the file should be printed at the top of the output.
 * For Parallel Launcher users, `ISVPRINT` in the Makefile must be set to 1.
 * For Ares users or N64 testing with a USB-enabled flashcart, `UNF` in the Makefile must be set to 1.
 * This suppresses a few debug prints to keep the console output to just the file to save.
 * 
 * If `TEST_LEVEL` is not set, this define will boot into `START_LEVEL`.
